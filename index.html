    <h1>Introduction to Neural Networks</h1>

    <p><em>Functions.</em> Plain and simple neural networks are functions. In their simplest form, functions can be likened to neural networks. But what exactly is a function, you might wonder? In essence, a function represents a relationship between one or more variables. Mathematically speaking, a function, when provided with an input, yields a unique output. So, how does this concept connect to neural networks?</p>

    <p>When we delve into the realm of model creation, our primary objective is to make predictions based on a given dataset. We take the input or the features of this data and feed them into our model, which effectively acts as a function. In return, we receive an output, which constitutes our predictions. In this sense, Neural Networks serve as universal function approximators. They excel at approximating the underlying function when presented with inputs and outputs, aiding us in deciphering complex functions that might otherwise elude our comprehension.</p>

    <h2>How Do Neural Networks work?</h2>
    
    <p>The overarching function is an intricate composition of numerous elementary units known as neurons, each of which processes a multitude of inputs to generate a single output. Within these neurons, each input is represented as a vector of numerical values (since computers operate on numbers, not words), which are then individually scaled by weights and aggregated alongside a bias term. These initial weight values are either user-defined or provided by a pre-trained model and serve as the foundation for computing the output. Gotta love <em>spaCy</em>.</p>

    <p>As the model progresses through its layers, it refines its performance by adjusting and fine-tuning these weights at each level. This iterative learning process enables the model to extract valuable insights from the previous layer’s computations, facilitating continuous improvement. For instance, upon inputting the initial vector along with the associated weights and bias into the first layer, the model undertakes a series of calculations to produce an output vector. Subsequently, this output vector is passed to the next layer, initiating a cascading sequence of transformations that eventually culminate in the model’s ultimate decision regarding the output.</p>

    <h2>How Do Neural Networks Run Calculations?</h2>

    <p>When a layer receives the input vector along with its associated weights, it performs a crucial operation: the dot product between the input vector and the weights. This resultant value is then subjected to an activation function, which plays a pivotal role in the neural network’s processing. Activation functions are responsible for mapping any numerical input to a constrained interval. For instance, the sigmoid function compresses values into the range of (0, 1), a transformation that streamlines computations by mitigating the influence of large numbers. While a comprehensive explanation of activation functions can be found in numerous articles online (which I’ll address in a future post), here’s a brief insight: the activation function, such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), defines the mathematical shape of the neuron, while the weights dynamically adjust and modify that shape.</p>

    <p>To illustrate, consider the analogy of training a neural network on the function y = x². Initially resembling a linear function, as the model progresses through training, it gradually morphs and adapts, ultimately taking the shape of a quadratic function. Each neuron within every layer plays a unique role in learning a distinct facet of the overall function, sort of like pieces of a puzzle harmoniously interlocking. The iterative training process unfolds as updated weight and parameter values are transmitted and fine-tuned across the layers.</p>

    <h2>How Do Neural Networks Learn?</h2>

    <p>As we repeatedly input data and make predictions, iterating through these cycles is referred to as ‘epochs.’ The reason neural networks improve with each successive epoch is due to their capacity to learn. So, what exactly does ‘learning’ entail, and what’s the fundamental objective of neural networks?</

    <p>The ultimate aim is to minimize error, often termed ‘loss.’ Loss measures the disparity between predicted outputs and actual outputs. As the neural network gains experience over time, it progressively reduces this error, thereby enhancing its efficiency. To accomplish this, it employs techniques like backpropagation and gradient descent (topics I’ll delve into later). As the network advances through epochs, it comprehends its errors through a defined loss function and tries not to repeat those mistakes.</p>

    <p>This is only an introduction to neural networks. I will go much more in-depth into this fascinating technology and the intricacies of it later. Thank you.</p>
